# Unconstrained

A guided introduction into the world of Constraint Programming in Python.
  
Constraint Programming (CP) is an 
immensely powerful paradigm that can and is used to solve seriously hard real world problems.  At it's best, CP allows the programmer to describe a problem, and have the best solution returned to them.

Most programmers are already intimately familiar with the most widely know declarative programming language - SQL.  When writing a SQL query you are describing your desired output - it is up to the database to figure out how.


While other optimisation tools in the AI space (Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Statistical models) 
have an abundance of sophisticated tutorials and sample repositories - I feel like the same cannot be said of Constraint Programming
